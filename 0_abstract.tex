In this project we have investigated and assessed wireless patient monitoring systems. Trough qualitative interviews we have investigated the infrastructure and practice of wireless ECG monitoring systems at two Norwegian hospitals. Combining what we learned from the existing solutions with different WBAN implementations found in literature, we propose a design for a wireless monitoring system based on available technology and open standards. We validated this design by building prototype that test certain critical aspects of wireless ECG monitoring. The prototype was based on a Bluetooth Smart enabled node, an Android gateway and a modern web-server for real time streaming.

In conclusion we see that the current version of Bluetooth Smart is able to support continuous streaming of clinical grade raw ECG at a 1500 Hz sampling rate with 24 bit samples. Whilst still having a battery life of more than 4 times as long as the solutions we investigated, and not exceeding a end to end delay of more than
