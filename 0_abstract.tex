In this project we have investigated and assessed wireless patient monitoring system. Trough qualitative interviews we have investigated the infrastructure and practice of wireless ECG monitoring systems at two Norwegian hospitals. Combining what we learned from the existing solutions with different WBAN implementations found in literature, we propose a design for a wireless monitoring system based on available technology and open standards. We validated this design by building prototype that test certain critical aspects of wireless ECG monitoring. The prototype was based on a Bluetooth Smart enabled node, an Android gateway and a modern web-server for real time streaming. (...)
